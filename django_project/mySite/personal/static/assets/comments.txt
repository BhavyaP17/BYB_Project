This folder contains the assets for the html files added.

LOADING STATIC FILES:

- If you have rendered your HTML files correctly and started up your development server, you will notice that your web pages exclude any stylesheets, images etc.

- You will need to load these in by creating a new folder in your webapp directory called static/.

- You then have to place the following code right at the beginning of your relevant HTML file (e.g. index.html) in the templates/ directory:
{% load static %}

- Also, you have to reference your items accordingly (for example an image tag would be):
<img src="{% static 'assets/image.jpg' %}">

- The image.jpg is in another folder in static called assets.
